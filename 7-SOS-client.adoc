=== 52째North Helgoland Sensor Web Viewer
The Helgoland Sensor Web Viewer developed by 52째North is an open source visualisation tool for different kinds of Sensor Web data. It allows to explore available observation data sets and to visualise the actual data (e.g. time series) as diagrams.

Figure 1 shows the map view of the Helgoland Sensor Web Viewer. In this case, a sample data set of the hackAIR project is explored. The map view shows the locations at which air quality sensors are located.

After selecting a specific measurement location, the data can be visualised as a diagram (see Figure 2). It is possible to combine data from multiple sensors, multiple observed properties and even from different providers into a single diagram.
