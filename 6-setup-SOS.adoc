[[SOS architectures]]
== SOS architectures
In this chapter we describe three architectures tested in the Interoperability Experiment that demonstrate end to end architectures as well as interoperability among

=== Architecture 1: SOS services integrated in a SOS client

== Setup SOS services

==== SOS in a JavaScript client
===== SOS and CORS

==== SOS in a data view
This is the grow and the heveland (52North).

=== SOS tested services
((This section will describe the different applications tested in the IE))

==== 52 North solution
SOS of 52north

==== istSOS
Easily manage your sensor network and distribute your data in a standard way

==== MiraMon SOS

==== GROW SOS

==== Practical Comparative
((This section will compare the different options with the same hardware and the same HackAir dataset))
