[[SOS architectures]]
== SOS architectures
In this chapter we describe three architectures tested in the Interoperability Experiment that demonstrate end to end architectures as well as interoperability among

=== Architecture 1: SOS services integrated in a SOS client

=== Architecture 2: SOS services integrated in a combined agile service

In this architecture a common server pulls two or more SOS requests into a central tabular datastore. This datastore records only the information from the returned SOS data that is required for the final visualisation and removes information that is redundant creating a data warehouse.
The common server would typically be a cloud server, but for some clients this is not necessary, if a data bridge is created between the data source and the visualisation tool.

=== Architecture 3: SOS service for interoperability and JSON API for fast client

== Setup SOS services

==== SOS in a JavaScript client
===== SOS and CORS

==== SOS in a data view
This is the grow and the heveland (52North).

=== SOS tested services
((This section will describe the different applications tested in the IE))

==== 52 North solution
SOS of 52north

==== istSOS
Easily manage your sensor network and distribute your data in a standard way

==== MiraMon SOS

==== GROW SOS

==== Practical Comparative
((This section will compare the different options with the same hardware and the same HackAir dataset))
